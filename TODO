Work to Consider
================

- Refactor types 
  * Ensure OpenGL 4 types work correctly
  * Ensure extension types work correctly
  * Reconcile GLhandleARB as void* on OS X and int on other platforms?
- Fix debug proc handling
- Add doc processing and emit function comments
- Test generation of non-GL packages
