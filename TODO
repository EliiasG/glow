Work to Consider
================

- Refactor types 
  * Ensure OpenGL 4 types work correctly
  * Use default C type when Go type conversion unavailable? (i.e., default to "C.<whatever>")
- Fix debug proc handling
- Add doc processing and emit function comments
- Extensions (commands & enums outside core GL features)
  * Filter extensions by compatibility with generated API
  * Include some Go bool indicating which extensions are available? pkg.Has<FunctionName>?
- Fix generation of non-GL packages
  * Incorrect package defintions
  * Incorrect function prefixes
  * ...? Certainly more is broken
