Work to Consider
================
- Fix OpenGL 4 types
- Fix debug proc
- Add doc URL
- Use default C type when Go type conversion unavailable? (i.e., default to "C.<whatever>")
- Extensions (commands & enums outside core GL features)
- Typedefs? (filter by what types are required for the functions and their dependencies)
- Refactor?
