Work to Consider
================
- Refactor types 
  * Ensure OpenGL 4 types work correctly
  * Use default C type when Go type conversion unavailable? (i.e., default to "C.<whatever>")
- Fix debug proc handling
- Add doc processing and emit function comments
- Extensions (commands & enums outside core GL features)
  * Filter extensions by compatibility with generated API
  * Include some Go bool indicating which extensions are available?
- Fix typedefs
  * Filter by what types are required for the generated functions and their dependencies
  * Prefer API-specific typedefs over API-agnostic ones
    ** Same fix is also necessary for enums
- Read all spec files when processing package specs
  * Generate all possible packages?
- Improve procaddr
  * Take an Init parameter instead of relying on a global variable
  * When no parameter is provided use procaddr/auto
